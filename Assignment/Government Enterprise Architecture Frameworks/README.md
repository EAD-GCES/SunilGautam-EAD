# Government Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (GEAFs)

Government Enterprise Architecture is defined as a whole of government approach to support government ecosystems by transcending boundaries for delivering services in a coordinated, efficient, and equitable manner.

Many governments are revitalizing public administration, overhauling public management, fostering inclusive leadership, and moving their public services to become more efficient, transparent, and accountable. This turning Government Enterprise Architecture to bridge policies and outcomes for better services.

Government Enterprise consists of a coordinated set of activity areas involving one or more public organizations and possibly third-party entities from private organizations or civil society.

A government-wide enterprise architecture will allow the government to reduce the costs of development and operations, while at the same time improving overall quality, by promoting interoperability and reuse of standard components. 

## Objectives of GEAF 

1. Understanding, clarifying and optimizing the inter-dependencies and relationships
among business operations, the underlying IT infrastructure and applications that support
these operations in government agencies and in the context of specific government
enterprises
2. Establishing a basis for agencies to share information, knowledge and technology and
other resources or jointly participate in the execution of business processes
3. Optimizing ICT investment and business cases across the whole of government by
enabling the opportunities for collaboration and sharing of assets, thus reducing the
tendency for duplicated and poorly integrated IT resources and capabilities

## The GEA framework comprises eight documents as described below:

1. Architectural Framework: Provides a high-level overview of all of below Architecture and Standards documents as well as guides agencies on how to apply them.

2. Business Reference Model: Defines a Business architecture framework and associated standards providing guidance on how new business services should be modeled, defined, developed, monitored and continuously improved throughout the service lifecycle.

3. Information Reference Model: Describes the Information exchange architecture approach and standards for sharing information data sets across government agencies.

4. Application Reference Model: Describes the Application reference architecture and standards to be used to create applications supporting Government services.

5. Infrastructure Reference Model: Describes the Infrastructure reference architecture and standards that will be the foundation for building application components and business services.

6. Security Management: Provides the GEA context to the related security and privacy requirements for government agencies.

7. Service Management: Defines the framework for managing IT services that are required to support the delivered services.

8. Governance Model: Defines the architecture governance framework to ensure effective adoption and evolution of reference architecture models across all the agencies in Government.

## Benefits of GEAF:

- Helps to understand current business.
- Identify opportunities for change.
- Model business goals and the capabilities and investments you need to deliver them.
- Design a future operating model that is technically and strategically aligned with all-of-government programs and services.
